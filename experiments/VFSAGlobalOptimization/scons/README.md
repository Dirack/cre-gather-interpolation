# VFSA CRS parameters Global optimization

> Development of SConstruct to obtain the CRS parameters RN, RNIP and BETA from a modeled data cube,
> using the Very Fast Simulated Annelling (VFSA) algorithm to optimize the parameters searching.
> This script uses the Non-hyperbolic CRS approximation and semblance criteria to adjust the approximation
> in the modeled data.
